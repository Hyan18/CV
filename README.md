## About me

I am a full stack web developer which has recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), an intensive 16 week developer bootcamp. Before Makers, I graduated from University College London with a First Class Honours in Mathematics which developed many of my skills including problem solving. It was here that I was first introduced to programming through an introductory course in Python and then later an exclusive 2-day intensive workshop hosted by Dr Stephen Lynch FIMA SFHEA. All of this has culminated into a genuine excitement for technology and has made my developer journey a joy, every step of the way.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail
Having done mathematics at university I have become more attentive as there can be cases in problems where very small details can change the solution entirely and when working independently, which is a vital part of university, it is important that you are able to catch where you made mistakes so you can learn from them. I was praised for my attention to detail during an internship at EY where I spotted an error in a fund report which saved a lot of remediation time further down the line.

#### Teamwork
I have worked in various team throughout my time at university and internships at EY. An example of this is during one of my internships at EY where we participated in a business challenge at ICAEW. We were grouped in teams and were required to analyse a case study and then present to a panel of judges with a business strategy and my team ended up winning.
